# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This example project demonstrates how the [gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) algorithm may be used to solve a [linear regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) problem.

The project showcases how a gradient descent may be used to solve the linear regression problem of fitting a line to a set of points in JavaScript. React is used as view later. In this problem, we wish to model a set of points using a line. The line model is defined by two parameters - the line's slope `m`, and y-intercept `b`. Gradient descent attemps to find the best values for these parameters, subject to a cost function.
